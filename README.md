# lua-resty-http


Lua HTTP client driver for [ngx_lua](https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module) based on the cosocket API. Supports HTTP 1.0 and 1.1, including chunked transfer encoding for response bodies, and provides a streaming interface to the body irrespective of transfer encoding.

## Status

This is newish but passes tests. Please send any design feedback or actual bugs on the issues page.

## API

### Connection

#### new

`syntax: httpc = http.new()`

Creates the http object. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

#### connect

`syntax: ok, err = httpc:connect(host, port, options_table?)`

`syntax: ok, err = httpc:connect("unix:/path/to/unix.sock", options_table?)`

Attempts to connect to the web server.

Before actually resolving the host name and connecting to the remote backend, this method will always look up the connection pool for matched idle connections created by previous calls of this method.

An optional Lua table can be specified as the last argument to this method to specify various connect options:

* `pool`
: Specifies a custom name for the connection pool being used. If omitted, then the connection pool name will be generated from the string template `<host>:<port>` or `<unix-socket-path>`.

#### set_timeout

`syntax: httpc:set_timeout(time)`

Sets the timeout (in ms) protection for subsequent operations, including the `connect` method.

#### set_keepalive

`syntax: ok, err = httpc:set_keepalive(max_idle_timeout, pool_size)`

Puts the current connection immediately into the ngx_lua cosocket connection pool.

You can specify the max idle timeout (in ms) when the connection is in the pool and the maximal size of the pool every nginx worker process.

In case of success, returns `1`. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

Only call this method in the place you would have called the `close` method instead. Calling this method will immediately turn the current http object into the `closed` state. Any subsequent operations other than `connect()` on the current objet will return the `closed` error.

Note that calling this instead of `close` is "safe" in that it will conditionally close depending on the type of request. Specifically, a `1.0` request without `Connection: Keep-Alive` will be closed, as will a `1.1` request with `Connection: Close`.

#### get_reused_times

`syntax: times, err = httpc:get_reused_times()`

This method returns the (successfully) reused times for the current connection. In case of error, it returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

If the current connection does not come from the built-in connection pool, then this method always returns `0`, that is, the connection has never been reused (yet). If the connection comes from the connection pool, then the return value is always non-zero. So this method can also be used to determine if the current connection comes from the pool.

#### close

`syntax: ok, err = http:close()`

Closes the current connection and returns the status.

In case of success, returns `1`. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.


### Requesting

#### request

`syntax: res, err = httpc:request(params)`

Returns a `res` table or `nil` and an error message.

The `params` table accepts the following fields:

* `version` The HTTP version number, currently supporting 1.0 or 1.1.
* `method` The HTTP method string.
* `path` The path string.
* `headers` A table of request headers.
* `body` The request body as a string.

When the request is successful, `res` will contain the following fields:

* `status` The status code.
* `headers` A table of headers.
* `body_reader` An iterator function for reading the body in a streaming fashion.
* `read_body` A method to read the entire body into a string.
* `read_trailers` A method to merge any trailers underneath the headers, after reading the body.

##### res.body_reader

The `body_reader` iterator can be used to stream the response body in chunk sizes of your choosing, as follows:

````lua
local reader = res.body_reader

repeat
  local chunk, err = reader(8192)
  if err then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
    break
  end
  
  if chunk then
    -- process
  end
until not chunk
````

If the reader is called with no arguments, the behaviour depends on the type of connection. If the response is encoded as chunked, then the iterator will return the chunks as they arrive. If not, it will simply return the entire body.

Note that the size provided is actually a **maximum** size. So in the chunked transfer case, you may get chunks smaller than the size you ask, as a remainder of the actual HTTP chunks.

##### res:read_body

`syntax: body, err = res:read_body()`

Reads the body into a local string.


##### res:read_trailers

`syntax: res:read_trailers()`

This merges any trailers headers underneath the `res.headers` table itself.


#### request_uri

`syntax: res, err = httpc:request_uri(uri, params)`

The simple interface. Options supplied in the `params` table are the same as in the generic interface, and will override components found in the uri itself.

In this mode, there is no need to connect manually first. The connection is made on your behalf, suiting cases where you simply need to grab a URI without too much hassle.

Additionally there is no ability to stream the response body in this mode. If the request is successful, `res` will contain the following fields:

* `status` The status code.
* `headers` A table of headers.
* `body` The response body as a string.


### Utility

#### parse_uri

`syntax: local scheme, host, port, path = unpack(httpc:parse_uri(uri))`

This is a convenience function allowing one to more easily use the generic interface, when the input data is a URI.
